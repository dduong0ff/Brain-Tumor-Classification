# Brain-Tumor-Classification

Performing Brain-Tumor Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Models

3 Versions of CNNs were compared to evaluate accuracy performance

- From scratch CNN: (4 convolutional layers)
  
- ResNet34 (transfer learning)
  
- VGG19 (transfer learning)

## Dataset

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset
